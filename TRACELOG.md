# Trace Log

## Entry 1
- **Prompt/Task**: Port the OriginalChickens mod to NeoForge 1.21.1 and begin the ModernChickens project.
- **Steps**:
  1. Created a dedicated NeoForge Gradle project with wrapper configuration and metadata tailored for the Modern Chickens mod.
  2. Reused the legacy resource bundle by wiring the original assets directory into the new source set to avoid duplicating binaries.
  3. Implemented foundational registry/data classes (`ChickensRegistry`, `ChickensRegistryItem`, `SpawnType`) updated to modern APIs and tagging systems.
  4. Added an initial mod entry point and registry bootstrap that compiles against NeoForge 1.21.1, including a placeholder item for smoke testing.
  5. Resolved build-time dependency gaps and executed a full `gradle build` to confirm the scaffolding compiles successfully.
- **Rationale**: Establishing a clean buildable skeleton ensures future ports of entities, blocks, GUIs, and gameplay logic can iterate safely on top of a verified NeoForge 1.21.1 foundation.

## Entry 2
- **Prompt/Task**: Continue porting OriginalChickens functionality by loading the legacy chicken roster and configuration into the NeoForge project.
- **Steps**:
  1. Added configuration support with `ChickensDataLoader`, carrying over the original per-chicken tuning controls via a modernised properties file and updating the runtime config holder.
  2. Recreated the legacy chicken catalogue in `DefaultChickens`, adapting item and block references to 1.21.1 resources while wiring in placeholder liquid egg items.
  3. Registered stubbed versions of the analyzer, spawn egg, colored egg, and liquid egg items plus the liquid egg registry data so downstream systems have concrete identifiers to bind against.
  4. Hooked the common setup event to bootstrap the data pipeline and verified the resulting build with `gradle --no-daemon --console=plain build`.
- **Rationale**: Loading the full chicken definitions early allows subsequent ports (entities, rendering, GUIs) to rely on accurate data parity, while the configuration bridge keeps existing worlds and packs customisable during the migration.

## Entry 3
- **Prompt/Task**: Begin the entity rewrite so ModernChickens can spawn and breed custom chickens in NeoForge 1.21.1.
- **Steps**:
  1. Implemented `ChickensChicken`, porting the legacy stat tracking, egg-laying cadence, breeding maths, and loot handling to the modern SynchedEntityData, Component, and NBT APIs.
  2. Created `ModEntityTypes` and updated `ModRegistry` to register the custom chicken entity alongside a NeoForge `DeferredSpawnEggItem`, ensuring players can summon the bird while the rest of the content pipeline is ported.
  3. Integrated modern enchantment lookups, fire immunity, and spawn heuristics to mirror the original behaviour, and confirmed the code compiles with `gradle build --console=plain` after wiring the new packages into the project.
- **Rationale**: Getting the bespoke chicken entity running early unlocks iterative testing of breeding, drops, and future block/menu ports while keeping behaviour identical to the legacy Forge release.

## Entry 4
- **Prompt/Task**: Continue rewriting OriginalChickens functionality by modernising the mod items, projectile entity, and creative tab integration.
- **Steps**:
  1. Implemented dedicated item classes for the spawn egg, coloured egg, liquid egg, and analyzer, storing chicken IDs via custom data components and updating tooltips to the NeoForge 1.21.1 API.
  2. Ported the coloured egg projectile to a new `ColoredEgg` entity, registered it alongside its renderer, and wired fresh creative tab population plus item colour handlers.
  3. Replaced placeholder registry entries with the new items, added a data-driven client event subscriber, and confirmed the new functionality compiles by running `gradle build --console=plain`.
- **Rationale**: Rebuilding the mod’s core items and projectile support restores key gameplay loops (spawning, dye throwing, liquid placement, and stat analysis) while establishing the client hooks required for future block and GUI ports.

## Entry 5
- **Prompt/Task**: Continue rewriting what we need to rewrite in order to get the OriginalChickens mod fully and identically functional in NeoForge.
- **Steps**:
  1. Recreated the henhouse as a modern block, block entity, menu, and screen, preserving energy consumption, sided inventory rules, and GUI layout while wiring new deferred registries and creative tab hooks.
  2. Added resource data (blockstate, models, loot table, localisation) so the henhouse renders correctly and drops itself, and updated the chicken entity to funnel eggs into nearby henhouses before spawning leftovers.
  3. Registered the new menu screen client-side and exposed container data syncing to keep the energy bar responsive, ensuring chickens, players, and automation interact with the storage block like the legacy release.
- **Rationale**: Porting the henhouse restores the series’ core automation loop—collecting eggs, converting hay to dirt, and presenting progress through the GUI—bringing ModernChickens closer to feature parity with OriginalChickens.

## Entry 6
- **Prompt/Task**: Continue rewriting what we need to rewrite in order to get the OriginalChickens mod fully and identically functional in NeoForge.
- **Steps**:
  1. Added a biome modifier that reads the chicken registry and global configuration to inject natural spawn entries for modded chickens across overworld, snowy, and nether biomes.
  2. Registered the modifier’s codec and runtime instance so NeoForge can discover the dynamic spawn rules without relying on generated data packs.
  3. Hooked the spawn placement registry through the mod event bus, reusing vanilla chicken height maps while applying the mod’s stricter biome and configuration checks.
- **Rationale**: Restoring automatic world spawning lets ModernChickens worlds feel alive without manual egg usage, matching the behaviour of the legacy mod while honouring player configuration tweaks.

## Entry 7
- **Prompt/Task**: Continue rewriting what we need to rewrite in order to get the OriginalChickens mod fully and identically functional in NeoForge.
- **Steps**:
  1. Registered an item capability provider that exposes liquid eggs as drainable buckets through a dedicated `LiquidEggFluidWrapper`, allowing automation to consume fluids just like in the legacy release.
  2. Hooked the capability registration into the shared registry bootstrap so the handler becomes available before other mods query item capabilities.
  3. Ported the “teach chicken” interaction to NeoForge’s modern `PlayerInteractEvent`, swapping vanilla chickens for the smart chicken entity when players right-click with a book.
- **Rationale**: Reintroducing the liquid egg fluid interface and smart chicken conversion keeps long-standing automation and progression loops intact, preserving parity with the OriginalChickens experience while using NeoForge’s current APIs.

## Entry 8
- **Prompt/Task**: Continue rewriting what we need to rewrite in order to get the OriginalChickens mod fully and identically functional in NeoForge.
- **Steps**:
  1. Re-registered the henhouse block through a shared helper so oak, spruce, birch, jungle, acacia, and dark oak variants all point at the same behaviour while still exposing the map colour hook for wood-specific tinting.
  2. Expanded the henhouse block entity type to accept every variant and wired the creative tab to surface each block item, keeping world interaction and discovery aligned with the 1.10 release.
  3. Ported the analyzer shapeless recipe plus six wood-specific henhouse recipes and loot tables into JSON data packs, paired with fresh blockstate and model definitions so the original art renders correctly.
- **Rationale**: Restoring the decorative henhouse variants and their crafting paths preserves the building flexibility and automation parity players expect from OriginalChickens while adopting modern NeoForge registries and data assets.

## Entry 9
- **Prompt/Task**: Continue rewriting what we need to rewrite in order to get the OriginalChickens mod fully and identically functional in NeoForge.
- **Steps**:
  1. Updated the default chicken registry so water and lava chickens lay liquid eggs tagged with the correct registry id, preserving the original automation loops.
  2. Extended the configuration loader to persist and restore liquid egg metadata while remaining compatible with legacy `eggItemMeta` properties.
  3. Synced the new configuration keys back to disk so freshly generated config files document the new `eggType` and `dropType` options for liquid variants.
- **Rationale**: Carrying the liquid egg subtype through default data and user configuration ensures every chicken still produces the correct fluid without manual NBT edits, matching the behaviour of the legacy mod on the modern registry stack.

## Entry 10
- **Prompt/Task**: Continue rewriting what we need to rewrite in order to get the OriginalChickens mod fully and identically functional in NeoForge.
- **Steps**:
  1. Registered a dedicated creative tab that reflects the legacy Chickens inventory, populating it from the runtime chicken and liquid registries so configuration edits immediately affect the menu.
  2. Exposed the henhouse item list for reuse and wired the creative tab registry into the main bootstrap alongside the other deferred registers.
  3. Restored per-variant naming for colored and liquid eggs while porting the 1.10 translation strings into `en_us.json`, ensuring tooltips and item names match the original release.
- **Rationale**: Surfacing the mod’s content through a bespoke tab and familiar localisation keeps the port feeling authentic while letting players quickly find every chicken egg variant in modern NeoForge builds.

## Entry 11
- **Prompt/Task**: Continue rewriting what we need to rewrite in order to get the OriginalChickens mod fully and identically functional in NeoForge.
- **Steps**:
  1. Added JEI as a compile/runtime dependency and recreated the five legacy Chickens recipe categories with modern GUI helpers and the original textures.
  2. Wired the plugin to emit laying, drop, breeding, throwing, and henhouse entries using the live chicken registry so configuration changes immediately flow into JEI.
  3. Registered appropriate catalysts and localisation strings so the categories present the same experience as the 1.10 release while fitting NeoForge’s component APIs.
- **Rationale**: Restoring JEI integration gives players in-game documentation for every breeding path, drop, and henhouse mechanic, preserving the mod’s usability while continuing the port to NeoForge 1.21.1.

## Entry 12
- **Prompt/Task**: Continue rewriting what we need to rewrite in order to get the OriginalChickens mod fully and identically functional in NeoForge.
- **Steps**:
  1. Added a reflective Jade bridge that reuses the legacy Waila IMC registration to expose chicken stats in the overlay without introducing a fragile compile-time dependency.
  2. Mirrored the original tooltip contents in the dynamic provider, respecting analyser state and configuration so players see tier, stat, and lay progress just like in 1.10.2.
  3. Updated the chicken entity to tick its lay progress synchronisation every server tick, keeping analyser readouts and overlays accurate throughout the egg-laying cycle.
- **Rationale**: Reinstating the in-world stat overlay and fixing the synced lay timer keep the modern port aligned with the quality-of-life features players relied on in OriginalChickens while staying resilient to future Jade API shifts.

## Entry 13
- **Prompt/Task**: Continue rewriting what we need to rewrite in order to get the OriginalChickens mod fully and identically functional in NeoForge.
- **Steps**:
  1. Restored the legacy `chickens.gml` dump by exporting the enabled registry entries after bootstrap, matching the original mod's breeding graph output.
  2. Mirrored the Nether-highlighting logic so graph nodes that require venturing into the Nether keep their distinctive colour coding.
  3. Logged success/failure and ensured directories are created with UTF-8 output so the modern port behaves predictably across platforms.
- **Rationale**: Reintroducing the breeding graph generator preserves a popular debugging and planning tool from OriginalChickens, giving pack authors the same bird progression map they relied on while porting to NeoForge.

## Entry 14
- **Prompt/Task**: Continue rewriting what we need to rewrite in order to get the OriginalChickens mod fully and identically functional in NeoForge.
- **Steps**:
  1. Extracted the breeding graph writer into `BreedingGraphExporter` so command and bootstrap paths share identical logic.
  2. Registered a `/chickens export breeding` Brigadier command that regenerates the graph on demand with clear success and failure feedback for operators.
  3. Hooked the command listener into the NeoForge event bus and added localisation strings so the runtime messages match the mod's polished presentation.
- **Rationale**: Letting players and server admins refresh the breeding graph without restarting keeps the modern port as convenient as the legacy mod while ensuring every export runs through the validated writer.
