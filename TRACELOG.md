# Trace Log

## Entry 1
- **Prompt/Task**: Port the OriginalChickens mod to NeoForge 1.21.1 and begin the ModernChickens project.
- **Steps**:
  1. Created a dedicated NeoForge Gradle project with wrapper configuration and metadata tailored for the Modern Chickens mod.
  2. Reused the legacy resource bundle by wiring the original assets directory into the new source set to avoid duplicating binaries.
  3. Implemented foundational registry/data classes (`ChickensRegistry`, `ChickensRegistryItem`, `SpawnType`) updated to modern APIs and tagging systems.
  4. Added an initial mod entry point and registry bootstrap that compiles against NeoForge 1.21.1, including a placeholder item for smoke testing.
  5. Resolved build-time dependency gaps and executed a full `gradle build` to confirm the scaffolding compiles successfully.
- **Rationale**: Establishing a clean buildable skeleton ensures future ports of entities, blocks, GUIs, and gameplay logic can iterate safely on top of a verified NeoForge 1.21.1 foundation.

## Entry 2
- **Prompt/Task**: Continue porting OriginalChickens functionality by loading the legacy chicken roster and configuration into the NeoForge project.
- **Steps**:
  1. Added configuration support with `ChickensDataLoader`, carrying over the original per-chicken tuning controls via a modernised properties file and updating the runtime config holder.
  2. Recreated the legacy chicken catalogue in `DefaultChickens`, adapting item and block references to 1.21.1 resources while wiring in placeholder liquid egg items.
  3. Registered stubbed versions of the analyzer, spawn egg, colored egg, and liquid egg items plus the liquid egg registry data so downstream systems have concrete identifiers to bind against.
  4. Hooked the common setup event to bootstrap the data pipeline and verified the resulting build with `gradle --no-daemon --console=plain build`.
- **Rationale**: Loading the full chicken definitions early allows subsequent ports (entities, rendering, GUIs) to rely on accurate data parity, while the configuration bridge keeps existing worlds and packs customisable during the migration.
