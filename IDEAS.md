# Modern Chickens Idea Board

This document is for cataloguing and detailing potential ideas for features.

## Implemented

* Better Mod Integration - Create chickens for popular mod resources that are not ingots/liquids/chemicals. (Essence, Alloys, Certus Quartz, Plastic, Magic, Blood, Oils, Flux, etc)

* Chicken Expansion - Create an additional Tier of chickens that are attainable via various methods. Such as an Ender Dragon Chicken that requires Dragon's Breath and/or a Dragon Egg, or a Wither Chicken that requires Nether Stars.
    * Perhaps modify the Dousing Machine to accept Dragon's Breath and/or Nether Stars

##  Current/Plausible

* Develop out 'Toxic' Chicken/Egg features
    * Radioactive/Toxic Chickens and Eggs that require care to handle

* Dedicated Mod-Book - Have an in-game guide-book for the Modern Chickens mod.

* Achievements - Add achievements for milestones in Modern Chickens.


## Far-Out Ideas

* Mob Farming/Grinding - Develop a 'Toxic Hen House' where players can house toxic (Radioactive, toxic chemical) chickens and have their toxicity radiate outwards from the Toxic Hen House - killing anything nearby.

* Funny/Gag/Meme Chickens - Use existing unused assets to create joke chickens.

* Time Egg - When thrown speeds up tick time in a small area for a short while (imagine accelerating crop growth or machine speed – basically a chicken-based Time in a Bottle).

* Weather Chicken - Controls rain and thunder by its clucking (laid eggs that, when cracked, can change weather).

* Chicken Generator - Turns standard chicken byproducts (Meat, Feathers, Eggs) into RF

* DNA Splicing - Ability to extract DNA from high-stat chickens to apply to other chickens.

* Mounts - Add some fun by letting players ride or use chickens for travel. A Giant Chicken Mount could be a tameable breed (perhaps breeding a chicken with a horse?). This idea integrates well with exploration: players might search for the ingredients to create a Chocobo-like chicken mount.

* Summoning & Familiars – Add new mobs or summonable creatures via chicken items.
    * Chest Chicken - Has an internal storage that can carry items for you!
    * Nether Chest Chicken - Same as above, but nether!
    * A Chicken that attacks enemies. (Fireball??)
    * Crafting Chicken - Acts as a mobile crafting table (saves contents)
    * Furnace Chicken - Cooking on the go!
    * Shoulder Chicken - Small chicken that rides on the players' shoulder.
    * Vacuum Chicken - Has an internal storage, vacuums nearby dropped items. (saves contents)
    * Battery Chicken - Walking RF Storage - Wirelessly supplies to nearby machines.

* Chicken Dimension - For a huge exploration addition, consider a new dimension or area themed around chickens. This could be a “Sky Hen Sanctuary” dimension accessed by using a special egg (similar in spirit to the Aether or Twilight Forest portals). In this realm, players find floating islands made of giant nests, exclusive breeds (like Cloud Chickens or Thunderbirds), and perhaps a unique dungeon or mini-boss (Mother Hen boss guarding rare eggs). While creating a full dimension is a large undertaking, even a smaller-scale area or structure could work: e.g. Chicken Temples that spawn in the world, filled with hostile “feral chickens” and guarding a loot chest of rare eggs. This adds exploration gameplay – players have reasons to leave their base and seek out legendary chickens in far-off lands or structures.

* Cybernetic “Smart Chickens” – Introduce cyber-chickens augmented with robotic parts and AI. Players could craft an Avian Augmentation Station to install modules (e.g. night vision, item scanning, increased production) onto chickens. These cyborg chickens might interface with Redstone Flux power: for example, a cyber chicken could directly charge devices or act as a walking battery. This would build on the mod’s existing RF-generating chickens, taking automation further with programmable, upgradeable chickens. Imagine a Motherboard Hen that links to a base’s network and manages all your coops autonomously – a playful nod to mods that let you automate animal farms with high-tech machines (similar in spirit to Industrial Foregoing’s animal rancher, but chicken-themed).

* Quantum Coop Chunk Loader – A high-tech coop structure that keeps areas loaded and working even when players are far away. Inspired by the ChickenChunks mod’s eponymous chunk loader (a block that keeps chunks loaded in memory), this feature could be a Quantum Entangled Henhouse: a coop that, when supplied with power or special feed, generates a field keeping nearby chunks active. The model could humorously resemble a chicken sitting on a satellite dish. This ensures your automated chicken farms and machines run 24/7. It ties into Tech by using energy (perhaps Flux Eggs as fuel) and into Modern Chickens’ theme by looking like a futuristic coop. Such a block would let creative players build grand automated farms without worrying about chunk unloading – useful for maintaining breeding or resource output continuously, much like existing chunk loaders in tech mods.

* Robotic Chicken Drones – Unlockable in late Tech tiers, players could build flying chicken drones that perform tasks. These drone companions (shaped like metallic chickens with rotor blades) would automatically collect drops, fertilize crops with manure, or attack hostile mobs in patrol mode. This adds a lighthearted futuristic take on automation – think miniature chicken robots zipping around your base carrying items. They could run on energy (recharged via sitting on a powered roost pad). This idea draws from the automation helpers in mods like OpenComputers or PneumaticCraft drones, but in a chicken-themed comedic form. It extends Modern Chickens into the realm of buildable contraptions, giving tech-savvy players new toys to engineer.

* Chicken Ore Processing - Develop a method for chickens to drive ore multiplication/production.

* Wireless Chicken Power - Develop a way for Chickens to produce RF Wirelessly to a set area.
