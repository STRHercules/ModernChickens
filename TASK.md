Fluid & Fuel Eggs – Expand the “liquid egg” concept to tech resources. Introduce chickens that lay fluid-filled eggs (water, lava, oil/fuel, XP juice, etc.), each storing a bucket of fluid. Players could use an Avian Fluid Converter block (akin to the RF converter) to drain these eggs into tanks or machines. For instance, a Lava Chicken could lay “Molten Eggs” that act like lava buckets for smelting or power generation. This would synergize with mods like Immersive Engineering or BuildCraft (fuel oils), and even support Mekanism (e.g. a Biofuel Chicken or Nuclear Chicken laying Uranium eggs!). Such integrations ensure that if those mods are installed, your chickens can produce their fluids or materials. (Imagine a Radioactive Egg that contains a bit of nuclear waste – requiring safe handling, of course!)
