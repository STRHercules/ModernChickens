# Suggestions

- Add tiered upgrades for the Avian Dousing Machine (e.g., faster infusion, extra buffer capacity, recipe selection UI) so mid-to-late game automation feels more rewarding than the baseline machine.
- Add a muffler or speed-upgrade mechanic for the Incubator so late-game automation can reduce noise or increase throughput once the base recipe is unlocked.
- Teach the new JEI dousing entry a transfer handler so players can push the layout into the machine and get inventory assistance when reagents are missing.
- Flesh out the placeholder registry scaffolding by porting entity, block, GUI, and integration classes from the legacy project using the new NeoForge data-driven patterns.
- Ship a small migration helper that purges legacy `layItemMeta=0` entries or rewrites them to the detected chicken id so existing `chickens.cfg` files stop overriding typed egg metadata on next launch.
- Audit any remaining runtime recipe and loot registrations and migrate them to JSON data packs compatible with 1.21.1.
- Surface a JEI entry for the Avian Dousing Machine that lists reagent costs and RF usage so players can confirm requirements without hovering over the GUI.
- Add a lightweight automated regression that snapshots the dousing machine's NBT, reloads it, and asserts the RF buffer persists so future refactors cannot reintroduce zeroed energy.
- Replace the temporary debug item with the real Chickens content and add automated tests (e.g., data generators or unit tests) to guard the future porting work.
- Restore the bespoke behaviours for the analyzer, spawn egg, colored egg, and liquid egg items so the placeholders regain their legacy functionality.
- Once the custom chicken entity is settled, wire up dedicated spawn placement registration and biome modifiers so natural spawning matches the original mod instead of relying solely on spawn eggs.
- Reinstate the fluid capability wrapper for liquid eggs and port the analyzer GUI/henhouse inventories so item interactions can mirror the original mod’s storage and automation features.
- Consider exposing spawn weight overrides per chicken so datapacks or configs can fine-tune how frequently specific breeds appear in different biome categories.
- Rebuild the Jade integration hooks so in-world overlays recognise the analyzer and henhouse now that the JEI plugin has been modernised.
- Add simple data generators for henhouse models, loot, and recipes so future variants stay consistent without hand-maintaining dozens of JSON files.
- Add a regression test or data audit that verifies liquid egg chickens produce the correct typed items after configuration reloads, preventing future regressions when extending the registry.
- Mirror the legacy creative tab ordering by adding a comparator that sorts chickens by tier/id before populating display stacks, keeping the new tab consistent with nostalgic expectations.
- Replace the reflective Jade bridge with a direct API dependency once a stable Maven coordinate is available so the overlay keeps working if the compatibility shim is ever removed.
- Allow configuring the breeding graph export path or filename so dedicated servers can segregate outputs per world without manual cleanup.
- Add a simple asset lint or data-driven test that loads each spawn egg model to catch future texture regressions before they make it into a release build.
- Introduce a gameplay regression test (or QA checklist) that spawns and throws each coloured egg in a multiplayer environment to ensure entity data sync stays within vanilla bounds after future refactors.
- Add a small helper on `ChickensChicken` that returns a spawn group data wrapper for a given chicken id so dispensers and future spawn egg paths can inject the correct breed without reordering spawn logic by hand.
- Extend automated checks (or a QA script) to confirm chickens never emit vanilla eggs after the custom drop refactor so future merges that touch `aiStep` keep the bespoke laying behaviour intact.
- Add automated coverage for the new breeder and collector menus so progress syncing, seed consumption, and item transfers stay reliable across future refactors.
- Generate bespoke GUI textures for the roost, breeder, and collector once binary assets can be shipped so the new screens stop borrowing vanilla art.
- Explore lightweight in-world upgrades (e.g., range charms) so individual collectors can extend or shrink their scan radius without relying on the global configuration.
- Add a lightweight NeoForge config screen that exposes the new roost/breeder speed multipliers and egg toggle so pack makers can tweak values without hand-editing `chickens.cfg`.
- Monitor the maturation of NeoForge’s transfer API and migrate the new capability bindings away from `SidedInvWrapper` once a public `WorldlyContainerWrapper`/resource handler is exposed, keeping the item automation bridge future-proof.
- Add a lightweight validation (e.g., data gen or unit test) that asserts spawn egg stacks populate `CustomModelData`, catching regressions that would revert the icons to vanilla eggs.
- Consider exposing a config toggle that lets packs opt back into the Roost-style chicken icons for spawn eggs if they prefer the newer look.
- Replace the vanilla wool/trapdoor stand-ins used by the breeder curtain models with the original Roost curtain textures once binary assets can ship again, so the privacy state fully matches the legacy presentation.
- Add a Gradle validation step that warns when the legacy Roost texture folder is absent so developers notice missing art before packaging builds.
- Automate the chicken item model overrides from the registry so future breeds stay sorted without manual JSON edits.
- Expand the catcher recipe to accept shared egg/feather tags when Forge publishes them, preserving the old ore dictionary flexibility for modpack integrations.
- Add shapeless recipe variants that accept Forge dye tags for base chickens so modpacks with alternative dye items still unlock early progression without manual datapack edits.
- Add an in-game reload command for `chickens_custom.json` so dedicated servers can iterate on bespoke breeds without restarting between tweaks.
- Publish a JSON Schema for `chickens_custom.json` so pack makers can validate entries in their editors and avoid typos before launching the game.
- Teach the custom chicken loader to recognise friendly spawn-type aliases (e.g., `nether`) so legacy configs port cleanly without forcing manual enum renames.
- Validate that declared texture resources actually exist (or expose a toggle) so mis-typed filenames surface as actionable warnings before players encounter missing textures in-game.
- Allow `chickens_custom.json` to specify a dedicated tint template (separate from the rendered texture) so pack makers can keep high-contrast masks for generated colours without duplicating assets.
- Add a data-driven colour test that iterates over every generated chicken and asserts the dynamic texture matches its configured palette, catching regressions in the tinting pipeline before release builds ship.
- Introduce a debug/client config flag that escalates missing custom textures to hard errors so pack makers can opt into strict validation once their resource packs are finalised.
- Generate a lightweight runtime resource pack that mirrors custom chicken item sprites so datapacks can omit JSON model boilerplate while still shipping bespoke art.
- Add a lightweight `/chickens dumpItemSprites` debug command that lists every stitched chicken item texture so pack makers can confirm their datapack assets were discovered without digging through logs.
- Register custom chicken item textures with the atlas during `TextureStitchEvent.Pre` so resource packs that add brand-new sprites (not reused from the base mod) appear without relying on fallback tinting.
- Expose an explicit `tint_item` flag in `chickens_custom.json` so datapacks can opt certain chickens back into the colour overlay even when a bespoke sprite is supplied.
- Surface a lightweight debug HUD or chat command that lists chickens missing their configured item sprites after a reload so pack makers can correct typos without scanning lengthy logs.
- Emit a concise startup summary that reports how many bespoke chicken item sprites were stitched so datapack authors can confirm their textures loaded without digging through verbose logs.
- Add a lightweight regression test or debug assertion that iterates custom chickens after a resource reload and verifies their declared item textures stitched successfully, catching future atlas-hook regressions early.
- Surface an optional debug toggle that logs which texture atlas each custom chicken item sprite resolves from so datapack authors can spot unintended fallbacks between the dedicated chicken sheet and the shared inventory atlas.
- Expose an in-game tooltip indicator (e.g., "missing sprite" overlay) when a custom chicken item is currently showing the placeholder graphic so pack makers can spot unresolved assets without scanning the logs.
- Add a generated guard override to `models/item/chicken.json` that routes `custom_model_data` values above the bundled range back to the base model, preventing future regressions if the runtime override ever becomes unavailable.
- Add a lightweight client assertion (or log) during model bake that verifies the expected chicken texture atlas is registered, catching misconfigured atlas ids before they manifest as missing sprites in gameplay builds.
- Replace the reflective ModelBakery bridge with a public helper once NeoForge exposes an official baker factory so custom chicken sprites no longer rely on brittle reflection hacks.
- Emit a lightweight debug summary that reports whether each custom chicken reused a bundled model or required the generated fallback so pack makers can confirm their assets behaved as intended after reloads.
- Cache the generated `minecraft:item/generated` parent (or transition to a runtime resource pack) so repeated custom chickens avoid resolving the same model every render, keeping the override pipeline efficient as datapack counts grow.
- Add a lightweight client regression test or debug assertion that verifies chicken item stacks resolve their per-breed display names so future refactors don't revert tooltips and inventory labels back to the generic "Chicken" title.
- Expose configuration knobs for Flux Egg capacity scaling and the Avian Flux Converter's transfer rates so modpacks can balance energy progression without code changes.
- Document the Avian Flux Converter inside JEI/REI so players can review its energy capacity, accepted items, and transfer speed without guessing how many Flux Eggs they should invest.
- Provide a dedicated Jade/TOP data provider for the Avian Flux Converter so in-world overlays report the stored RF explicitly instead of relying on generic energy detection heuristics.
- Add a resource-pack audit that flags new folders under `AdditionalAssets/chickens/textures` so the build script can be updated alongside future asset drops instead of silently skipping categories like particles or block items.
- Add subtle particles or ambient audio cues when the Avian Flux Converter consumes a Flux Egg so players notice the transfer kicked off even without staring at the GUI.
- Consider persisting an "overcharged" flag on Flux Eggs so future upgrades can temporarily exceed the 50k buffer when linked to external batteries, letting the converter UI highlight bonus storage without rebalancing the base machine.
- Introduce a lightweight packet-based diagnostic (`/chickens debugFlux`) that prints the server's measured RF alongside the menu-mirrored value so future UI regressions can be spotted without guessing whether the client desyncs or the block entity miscounted energy.
- Factor the new 32-bit DataSlot splitter into a shared menu helper so upcoming machines can mirror large counters without duplicating the bit-packaging logic.
- Extend the Avian Flux Converter tooltip with a shift-activated section that lists max transfer rates and the last egg drain timestamp, giving players deeper diagnostics now that the base RF total is visible.
- Offer a synced config toggle for the WTHIT plugin so packs that already rely on another HUD mod can disable the duplicate overlay lines without forking the code.
- Mirror the real-time ETA normalisation logic inside the Jade tooltip helper so both overlays report consistent countdowns when stacked chickens speed up production.
- Add a lightweight client regression harness that validates roost and breeder block entities broadcast their inventory updates without opening the GUI, preventing future sync changes from reintroducing invisible chickens.
- Add an in-game manual or JEI info tab that mirrors the README's Redstone Flux math so players can review Flux Egg charge scaling and roost throughput without leaving Minecraft.

- Provide a lightweight Gradle task (e.g., `devplanCheck`) that fails the build when `DEVPLAN.md` drifts from the authoritative planning notes, keeping future roadmap edits synchronised between documentation and implementation discussions.
- Add config-driven toggles for liquid egg hazard effects and per-egg fluid volumes so modpacks can tone down the safety penalties or rebalance throughput alongside the upcoming Avian Fluid Converter.
- Teach the liquid egg loader to consult fluid tags (e.g., `forge:oil` or `forge:biofuel`) so future integrations can register once per tag instead of hard-coding every mod namespace, reducing maintenance when tech mods rename their fluids.
- Replace deprecated `FluidStack` helper calls (`getDisplayName`, `isFluidEqual`) with the modern NeoForge fluid API once the new compatibility shims land to keep the build free of removal warnings.
- Expose client-side controls for the liquid overlay (opacity, scroll speed, optional disable) so accessibility-focused packs and resource pack authors can tune the new animation without editing code.
- Add a Mekanism-focused tooltip or JEI info page that outlines how the Avian Chemical Converter routes chemical and gas outputs, so players understand side configuration and transfer rates at a glance.
- Surface a startup warning or diagnostics command when the Mekanism reflection bridge fails (e.g., future method renames) so pack makers notice registries that could not initialise instead of silently losing chemical/gas chickens.

- Add an in-game advancement hint that highlights dye-and-egg crafting for colour chickens so players discover the mechanic without consulting external guides.
- Surface the new natural spawn override as per-chicken configuration so datapacks or `chickens.cfg` entries can opt additional breeds into forced spawning without requiring code updates.
- Surface a Jade/TOP overlay for the Avian Dousing Machine that reports its stored RF, reagent levels, and per-infusion costs so automation builders can confirm resource readiness without opening the GUI.
- Extend the spawn plan datapack format with optional per-chicken weight tables or biome tag filters so packs can bias specific breeds toward deserts, jungles, or custom dimensions without editing code.
- Expand the new rooster entity with a dedicated mating goal, simple GUI, and datapack-driven seed consumption rates so Hatchery-style stud behaviour can be toggled and tuned per-pack while reusing ModernChickens' existing breeding graph and config systems.
