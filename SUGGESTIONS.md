# Suggestions

- Flesh out the placeholder registry scaffolding by porting entity, block, GUI, and integration classes from the legacy project using the new NeoForge data-driven patterns.
- Migrate runtime recipes and loot tables from script-based registration to JSON data packs compatible with 1.21.1.
- Replace the temporary debug item with the real Chickens content and add automated tests (e.g., data generators or unit tests) to guard the future porting work.
- Restore the bespoke behaviours for the analyzer, spawn egg, colored egg, and liquid egg items so the placeholders regain their legacy functionality.
